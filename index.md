## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3, part-1
    This was a fun lab because it offered a hands-on opportunity to calculate a personâ€™s BMR using code. I learned how to incorporate various parameters like age, weight, height, and gender into the calculations, which made the lab fun and rewarding. This lab made my coding skills better while deepening my understanding of the importance of BMR.

* Lab 7
    This was a fun lab because I learned how to code conditions that had to do with parking, which was a practical and engaging way to apply if statements. I gained experience in writing logic to check for available times to park. It was interesting to see how coding could be used to simulate real world scenarios.

* Lab 11, part-2
    This was my favorite lab because I was able to code a minigame called Hilo where you had 5 attempts to guess a number between 1-10. This lab specifically challenged my knowledge with logical programs and If functions. By the end I was having too much fun testing the lab than doing the lab itself.
